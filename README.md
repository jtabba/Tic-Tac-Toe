# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project was created during my third week in the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course, which I began with 0 prior coding/programming knowledge.

The current live version can be viewed via the link below:

## Initial Plan and outcome

The intention behind this project was to build an interactive 2-player tic-tac-toe game using JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3. My primary plan was to create seamless gameplay with a futuristic/captivating UI that changes based on players' actions during the round. 


## Outcome and reflection

Initially I encountered more difficulty than I anticipated when coding the game logic. Although I had learnt to understand and read Javascript code, planning and writing executable logic and using it with the DOM completely threw me off. 

My planning was a major contributor to this initial issue as I had spent hardly any time logically implementing the necessary steps required for the code to compile, let alone function. This of course only added to the stress of the project and caused me to needlessly waste time.

After sitting with a mentor and creating pseudocode which included all the necessary steps for a single functional win condition, I was able to fully grasp the conceptual reqiurements of the project and implement them on my own. This is a major lesson in my programming career that I will carry to my future projects.

Overall, I am happy with the project. I was able to implement all the basic features I wanted and actually impressed myself with the outcome. I had a lot of fun playing the game with friends and explaining the details about how it works.

Most importantly, I learnt that I thoroughly enjoy the critical thinking and problem-solving steps required to program (basic) software. I had never invested so many consistent hours which I enjoyed into a task. It is safe to say that I am hooked and am very excited to progress through the course and find a position in the software development industry.
